Visit the <a href=\"http://1964js.com/blog/index.html\">blog</a> on <a href=\"http://1964js.com\">1964js.com</a> to see videos and to download the original Windows version of 1964.\r\n\r\nTo build 1964js, run ./compile.sh from the root folder. \r\n\r\nPrerequisites:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Slim</li>\r\n<li>Sass</li>\r\n<li>CoffeeScript</li>\r\n<li>Java</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h1>To setup your Linux environment:</h1>\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install ruby\r\nsudo gem install slim\r\nsudo gem install sass\r\nsudo gem install coffeelint\r\nsudo apt-get install nodejs\r\nsudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy\r\nsudo apt-get install npm\r\nsudo npm install -g coffee-script\r\nsudo npm install -g coffeelint\r\nsudo npm install -g java\r\nsudo apt-get install default-jre\r\n```\r\n\r\n<h1>To setup your Windows environment (TODO):</h1>\r\n```\r\ninstall ruby\r\ninstall slim\r\ninstall sass\r\ninstall coffeelint\r\ninstall coffee-script\r\ninstall nodejs\r\ninstall npm\r\ninstall java (may cause security issues on Windows, be cautious [06-03-2015])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe script is known to work on Mac OS X Yosemite and Ubuntu 14.04 64bit. It should work on other platforms that have a Bash shell. We are working on Windows build instructions.\r\n\r\n1964js is (kind of) a port of our Nintendo 64 emulator for Windows called 1964. 1964 was written in C and C++ for Windows. You can still grab that <a href=\"http://1964emu.emulation64.com\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nThis project is still in the early stages. The initial goal of this project was to see how well Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript compiler performs.\r\n\r\nInstead of building a traditional dynamic recompiler (JIT compiler) as we did for 1964 on Windows, which translated MIPS directly to x86, 1964js dynamically writes JavaScript to the web page by reversing MIPS code to JavaScript. This JavaScript represents blocks of ROM code. Then, if using Chrome for instance, Google's V8 compiler compiles the JavaScript to native code for us automatically.\r\n\r\nFor updates, please check <a href=\"1964js.com\">1964js.com</a> and visit the Emutalk forums.\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out <a href=\"http://hulkholden.github.com/n64js/\">n64js</a> as well!.\r\n\r\nGreets to StrmnNrmn, author of n64js and Daedalus. By pure coincidence, we started JavaScript N64 emulators around the same time!\r\n\r\nSuper Mario 64 boots.
